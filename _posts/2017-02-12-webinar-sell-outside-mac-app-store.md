I will be hosting a webinar about distributing your app outside the Mac App Store next week. It's free, and you're very welcome to attend!

**Wednesday, February 15th, 2017 @ 10:00 AM PST** (will run 1 hour)

**[â†’ Register Now](http://info.fastspring.com/offers/more-money-more-control-webinar-registration)**

Topics include:

* Ditching the Mac App Store -- Why, and what it means.
* Is There Life After the Mac App Store? -- Choosing an e-commerce provider.
* Getting Back to Development -- How you change your code to work outside the Mac App Store.

Plus you'll see me live. That alone should be motivation for you to visit, no matter the topic :)

## Disclaimer, aka Code of Honesty and Transparency

Maybe you just arrived on my blog and don't know how I do things around here, yet, and how much I value morality over profit anytime. So let me erase your doubts about this webinar cooperation.

I use FastSpring to sell my stuff. I really like their service, so I [wrote a guide](/books/make-money-outside-mac-app-store-fastspring/) in 2015. FastSpring in turn was impressed by my initiative and helped me spread the word a bit and provide background info whenever I needed anything. **I am not getting paid by FastSpring for the book.** It's my own creative work. I maintain it because I think it helps you, fellow developer, to set up your own indie business.

Then late 2016, FastSpring approached me as their go-to expert for Mac app development. They plan to show how easy it is to use FastSpring to distribute Mac apps. In other words, they want to own part of the good news for obvious marketing reasons.

With the recent _Out-of-App-Store Success Stories_ by [Rogue Amoeba](https://weblog.rogueamoeba.com/2017/02/10/piezos-life-outside-the-app-store/) and [Kapeli](https://blog.kapeli.com/100-days-without-the-app-store), it may even be a growing market.

I was skeptical at first. I will not violate my strong ethics; teaching people the _One True Way_&trade; is more important than easy money. But I came to find FastSpring values delivering useful content over running a 60-minute ad show. From the get go, FastSpring wanted me to create the content. Not even once did they suggest I add something to my slides. They totally risk I go live on Wednesday and tell people to use a competing service. But I won't, because I know no better service provider. I liked the concept, so I agreed. **I am getting paid by FastSpring for this webinar gig.** But it's 100% my webinar.

To stay true to myself, I will give genuinely helpful advice to empower the attendees to become independent. Of course I'll show FastSpring's features, just like the screenshots I put in my book. All because I believe in their service, not because they bought my loyalty with the speaker fee. 

In short, this is not an advertisement for FastSpring. I haven't sold my soul. It's a cooperation out of mutual respect.

Hope to be seeing you around on Wednesday!
