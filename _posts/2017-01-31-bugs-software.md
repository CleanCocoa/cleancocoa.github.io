There's a lot to learn in terms of company culture from Basecamp (former 37signals). Shawn Blanc has [written about a workshop](https://thefocuscourse.com/the-basecamp-way-to-work-workshop-retrospective/) by Basecame. One thing I just had to share immediately is this: "Bugs are the edges of what works":

> Software simply has bugs. And so if it’s not a critical bug — (such as: if it’s not losing customer data) — then they probably won’t ever fix it. Because to fix an edge bug and chase them all down means they’re not making new things or improving features that really matter.

That's no excuse for a crappy user experience. But not every edge case has to be solved.
