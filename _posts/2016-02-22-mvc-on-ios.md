Jordan Morgan of Buffer [wrote about MVC on iOS][1]. The idea is simple. Don't mix view logic into the model; don't control all view minutiae from the controller; don't make intelligent views that fetch stuff from servers or similar.

His comparison of good VS bad execution of these principles is worth the read!
