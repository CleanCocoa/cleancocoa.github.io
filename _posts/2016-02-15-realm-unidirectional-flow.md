Sam Ritchie wrote ["Building a Unidirectional Data Flow app with Realm"](https://realm.io/news/unidirectional-data-flow-in-swift/) the other day. I haven't worked with Realm before, but the state propagation seems super interesting now that I dabble with [ReSwift](/posts/2016/01/reswift-level-indirection/) from time to time. His post excited me to try out Realm, soon.
