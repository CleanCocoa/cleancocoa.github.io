My very first iPhone / iPod Touch app [Calendar Paste](http://calendarpasteapp.com) hit the App Store this week!

It's about preparing events and pasting them into your calendar when needed.  Saves time for scheduling and entering team meetings, for example.

The fixed duration is a real time saver in my opinion.  No more spinning "Starts" and "Ends" in Apple's Calendar app.

[Get Calendar Paste on the iTunes App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendar-paste-2/id581693524?mt=8&uo=4&at=11lxCd)
