Users have reported update problems after they purchased the Word Counter for Mac.

I am aware of this issue. The easiest fix is to [download the latest version](http://wordcounterapp.com/download) (`.zip`, 2.3&nbsp;MB) yourself manually.

The version you got from the store cannot recognize more recent versions as valid, so it rejects the update. Maybe I can find a way to fix this on my side, soon. I pushed an update to the store already.

This is very unfortunate, and I'm very sorry for the trouble this has caused.

All the best to you,
