I like [this interactive guide][kaik] a lot, because it focuses on basic rules of nice-looking typography which result in a quite beautiful example page.

The reference to http://modularscale.com/ was nice, although I seem to fare well with a selection of the traditional scale:  16, 18, 21, 24, 36 (measured in `pt`;  I use `em`s, though).
