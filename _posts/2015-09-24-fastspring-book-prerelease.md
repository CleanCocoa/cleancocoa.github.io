I have written a book about releasing apps outside the Mac App Store. It comes with two fully working sample applications to cover checkout from within the app, licensing, and locking the app after a trial period.

It's called:

> _**Make Money Outside the Mac App Store**: How to Sell Your Mac App with FastSpring, Secure It With License Codes Against Piracy, and Offer Time-Based Trial Downloads._

I'd love to have feedback on this. 

If you want to help out, just shoot me a line at: _hi@christiantietze.de_ 

Thanks!
