Writing clean code makes your life better in the long term, and I find it's more fun initially. According to Bernstein, CLEAN is an acronym:

* **C**ohesive
* **L**oosely Coupled
* **E**ncapsulated
* **A**ssertive
* **N**on-Redundant

[His book "Beyond Legacy Code. Nine Practices to Extend the Life (and Value) of Your Software"][book] seems to be a good read. Not through, yet.[^aff]
