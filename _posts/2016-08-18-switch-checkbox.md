On the Mac, toggle or switch widgets aren't very common, yet. On iOS, you don't see lots of checkboxes. [This article on UX Movement](http://uxmovement.com/buttons/when-to-use-a-switch-or-checkbox/) points out that switches are for immediate actions while changes to checkboxes require a submit button to be pressed.

Now I think about preference panes in Mac apps. They usually perform changes to `NSUserDefaults` immediately. But using switches on a Mac still feels wrong. Maybe just because I'm not used to it, but still. 

macOS's Notification Center has a switch to toggle "Do not Disturb". It works, but I don't use it a lot, so there's not much opportunity to get accustomed to it.
