I just changed [the blog archive](/posts/) to show all past articles reduced to the titles on one page. There still are annual collections of the old-style excerpts. I hope it helps to browse the stuff I published over the years. 

Still I find the sheer mass of topics unwieldly. That's why I started to work on a curated and commented list of articles, like a table of contents. Will let you know when it's ready.
