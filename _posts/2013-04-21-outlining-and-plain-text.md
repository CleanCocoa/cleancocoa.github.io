The other day, Michael Schechter [complained](https://posts.app.net/4900077) Scrivener's outliner feature lacked a focus mode.  To this, Aaron Mahnke[^am] [laconically replied](https://posts.app.net/4903070):

I think this is a great idea.  And it works exceptionally with [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com)'s _Focus Mode_ to keep the outline visible at all times.

  [^am]: Judging from his posts and work, I think Aaron is a great guy and you should follow him on [Frictionless](http://www.getfrictionless.com/), his [portfolio page](http://aaronmahnke.com/), or @amahnke on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amahnke) and [ADN](https://app.net/amahnke).
