I'm working hard on the Word Counter. By October, I'm going to finish a really big feature: file and folder monitoring. It's a pretty tough ride till then to get it done.

Since the Word Counter is not on the Mac App Store, please **show your support and [leave a &#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605;&#x2605; rating on MacUpdate](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/51941/word-counter).**

You don't have to write a full review in order to leave a rating. Just click the five stars at the very top of the page -- but a review is much appreciated, of course!

As always: if you experience any hiccups on Yosemite or El Capitan, please tell me so I can fix the bugs.
