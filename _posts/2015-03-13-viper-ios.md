Ryan Quan of Brigade Engineering has published an article about [using the VIPER iOS app software architecture][be]. Their write-up is really good: message passing is illustrated with code samples -- and they even use neat box graphs!

I use a [VIPER][]-like approach in my apps, too, and I'd like to invite you to try it for yourself. VIPER is inspired by [Clean Architecture][clean] and [Hexagonal][hex].

In a nutshell, you decouple the view controllers from event handling from data management. You introduce so-called "Wireframes" to set up a module or "stack" of objects to display a view controller with certain data. The Wireframes set up everything once. Afterwards, event handlers take over, called "Presenters". They perform transitions between scenes. View controllers do not much more than setting up the view and reacting to `IBAction`s.

This will make maintaining code easier because the view controllers are finally put on a diet. Figuring out how data has to flow differently takes some getting used to. I'm going to write about this in a future post. <!--ct: TODO add link to VIPER data flow post-->
