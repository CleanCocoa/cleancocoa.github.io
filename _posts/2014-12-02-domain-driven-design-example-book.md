I'm adding a file monitoring feature to the Word Counter. This is a huge change to the application's source code. To tackle this problem with style, I mulled things over for a while and considered my existing application's design. I wanted to try out a few new things, so it was a no-brainer to start a sample project from scratch and fiddle with it.

I took notes and wrote about the process. Not just in journal-style, but educational. I miss good literature on the topic, and I want to contribute to Mac application design principles of those just getting started. [Domain-Driven Design][ddd] helped me keep the Word Counter manageable, and I think its principles are useful for other programmers, too.

The example project will be finished by the end of the week. By then, I'll know how to make progress with the Word Counter, too.

You can buy the book later this week on Leanpub. In the meantime, [sign up to be notified about its release][book]!

I'll open-source both the book and the sample project. Take a look at the current state on GitHub:

* [Manuscript](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-appdev-book)
* [Sample Project](https://github.com/DivineDominion/mac-appdev-code)
* [Book on Leanpub][book]

It's very exciting to release a writing project, no matter how small it is. I'm curious to see what the finished e-book will look like. There's still a lot to do.

If you're not into programming, try [leanpub.com](http://leanpub.com) for yourself. Maybe your next writing project waits to be available for others to see, too!
