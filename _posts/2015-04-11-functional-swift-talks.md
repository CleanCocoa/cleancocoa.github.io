After the latest change in my diet, I eat a lot more often throughout the day and try to spend the time watching educational talks to make use of my time. Functional programming seems to not only be all the hype -- its concepts seem to reach mainstream thinking, too. Here's a collection of talks you might find worth your while.

* [Functional Swift](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZyqQB76XCDkbAR4PwuOJ9IRcmnaxOgxL) -- conference recordings with tons of great stuff
* [Erik Meijer: _What does it mean to be Reactive?_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTSQlYX5DU0) -- taught me a lot about being explicit and honest in my return types
* [Neal Ford: _Functional Thinking_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7aYS9PcAITQ) -- how to use data transformations instead of a series of instructions
* [Erik Meijer: _Functional Programming_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0N1aZ6SnBk) -- shows what being stateful entails

If you got some useful talks, share them in the comments!
