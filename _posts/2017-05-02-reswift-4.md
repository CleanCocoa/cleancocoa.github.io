I totally forgot to bring this up: ReSwift [version 4](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift/releases/tag/4.0.0) was released 13 days ago!

The coolest part (in my opinion) is to skip duplicate states in subscriptions _if you want to._ The state has to be equatable somehow to do this with the default subscription measurements. But then again you're using this anyway right now with ReSwift 3.x, only for every subscriber.

```swift
store.subscribe(subscriber) {
  $0.select {
    ($0.testValue, $0.otherState?.name)
  }.skipRepeats {
    return $0 == $1
  }
}
```

The `skipRepeats` in the subscription builder/configuration block will be used automatically if the selected state conforms to `Equatable`. But you can use your own `skipRepeats` implementation if needed.

In theory, you could add `map` and  `filter` and whatnot to the underlying `Subscription` type that's being configured in the block you pass to `subscribe()`, though I don't see much value in this at the moment.
