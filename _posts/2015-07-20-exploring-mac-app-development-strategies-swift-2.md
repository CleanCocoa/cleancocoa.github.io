It's a good time to update my book for Swift 2: guard clauses improve readability, and do-try-catch error handling shows problem points. Protocol extensions are huge, but I had no use for them in the sample code, yet.

The update is live _now_. If you haven't bought the book in the past, **grab it until August 1st to save more than 50%**: [use the coupon **Swift2Yay**](http://leanpub.com/develop-mac-apps-clean-architecture-swift/c/Swift2Yay). The coupon is good for 10 copies, so be quick.

As always: tell me what you think!
