On Dec 11th I released [Calendar Paste][cp].  With yesterdays App Store statistics available, I now have a full month of sales statistics recorded.  I'm both happy and excited to share a few numbers with you on this first month anniversary.

I found it extremly hard to know about people who make a living from their little businesses.  Hence I decided to do a monthly wrapup, with fancy graphs and all!  This post will be an interlude to that schedule due to this special occasion.

Last weekend, a [post on iCulture][ic] resulted in a _surge_ of sales from [Benelux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benelux) countries.  With these blogosphere-induced peaks, I can't really see a trend.  Maybe below 10 sales per day?

In total, 342 downloads were registered.  Substract maybe 5 or 7 promo codes I gave away, I end up with **335 sales** in the first month after launch.  Currency conversions basically ignored, this equals roughly EUR 180,-- (USD 265).

I may repeat myself:  I didn't think this was going to happen.  More than 300 sales are great!  Just for the record:  this doesn't make up for a business model or anything --  It just makes me happy to see that I might someday get rid of a few side-jobs and support myself with sales of _products I care about and use myself._

You know what's strange about that long-term vision?  Doing stuff I care about would enable me to spend more time doing exactly that.
