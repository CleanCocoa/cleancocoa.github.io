As you may know, I'm totally immersed in getting [TableFlip](http://tableflipapp.com/) ready to ship. By some random circumstance, I recently stumbled upon [Paul Jarvis's getting started post](http://launchthisyear.com/getting-started-basics-of-online-business/evaluate-and-launch-your-idea-with-small-steps/) about online businesses.

I already read the hip books about startups: [Startup Owner's Manual](http://amzn.to/1NxRwfJ) (meh), [Lean Startup](http://amzn.to/24YZkeQ) (ok), [$100 Startup](http://amzn.to/1rTeHay) (inspiring), [Lean Entrepreneur](http://amzn.to/1NxRCnD) (meh), [Running Lean](http://amzn.to/1TjgIn5) (good one) -- you name it. I still found Paul's action-oriented collection valuable to get started. It's the little first steps that matter which I tend to forget sometimes.

With TableFlip, I wanted to know if a visual Markdown table editor would be something people liked. So I put together a landing page for it and asked around. By sheer luck I managed to get 300 subscribers in about a month. I'm excited to show them the first test build. -- Sadly, I cannot say that I have any fancy techniques to share. Being connected to other people that love to re-tweet your announcements or post links to their blogs helps a lot. Nothing else has had any effect for me, like, _ever._

I posted a link to Joa Allen's recommendation to get in touch with truly loyal people with a [free app MVP](/posts/2016/05/app-pricing-making-money/) that solves 80% of their problems already. 

The bottom line of all this is: _Just. Do. It._ You need feedback, so get something out as quickly as possible. Then you may be able to fend off starvation in the long run.
