Understanding Uncle Bob's [Principles of Object-Oriented Design][pood] (which resulted in the [SOLID][] principles) is super important to really grasp the use of design patterns (like MVVM) and architectural patterns (like VIPER). It's like the grammar for crafting proper object-oriented software.

And now here's the good news: there is a Swift playground (and Markdown file to read online) that illustrates all the principles by Uncle Bob: **[The Principles of OOD in Swift 2.2](https://github.com/ochococo/OOD-Principles-In-Swift)**

Check it out, take notes, and keep the principles close to your heart. They may save your life someday.
