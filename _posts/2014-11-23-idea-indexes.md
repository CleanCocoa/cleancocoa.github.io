Yesterday, I published a post on the "Zettelkasten Method" blog about [idea indexes][zkpost]. I uploaded photos of some idea indexes from my library to Flickr. **Join the ["Idea Indexes" group on Flickr][flickr] and share yours!**

If you have no clue what I'm talking about, let me quote [Cal Newport][cal], who brought the whole topic back to my mind:

> 1. As she [Maria Popova] reads, she creates an index at the front of the book that lists its most interesting ideas.
> 2. Every time she encounters a passage relevant to one of these ideas she adds the page to the relevant line in the index. If its a new idea, she creates a new line for it.
> 3. As she reads more, the index grows.


Maria Popova is the author behind [Brain Pickings][bp]. She reads a lot (15 books per week), and she has a huge [digital bookshelf](http://bookpickings.brainpickings.org/) with literally _endless_ scrolling.

She was [featured][podcast] by Tim Ferriss in his "Tim Ferriss Show" Podcast recently and talks about the method. 

The whole episode is worth a listen because the topics are very interesting and diverse: from reading to productivity to exercise to writing. It resonates with me because I think you can't fix problems in isolation. Instead, living The Good Life&tm; demands you push everything up a notch.

An excerpt of the show notes, taken from Tim's website:

* How to live a meaningful happy life. [10:00]
* The importance of writing for an audience of one. [12:10]
* Maria Popova’s daily rituals, beliefs on sleep, distraction-avoidance habits, meditation, and exercise routines. [23:25]
* Maria Popova’s note-taking system. [31:45]
* Self-reliance pathology and how to overcome it. [53:56]
* How to find a professional personal assistant and delegate. [56:40]
* What Maria Popova’s weight lifting regiment looks like, plus her favorite bodyweight-only exercise. [1:02:14]
* Blogging strategies [1:05:22]
* How do you deal with friends who want you to read their books? [01:27:10]
