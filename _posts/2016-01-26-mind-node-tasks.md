I love [Mind Node for Mac](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mindnode-2-delightful-mind/id992076693?mt=12&uo=4&at=11lxCd). Now they added tasks. I think that's weird, but I can see how this is useful for some people. You can devise plans and operate on them without having to export the outline to a task management application, for example.

It looks great and maybe I can use this for a little side-project which doesn't really need traditional taks (which I put into [OmniFocus]()) but could benefit from checking off items nevertheless.
