Vikas Thakur is an INTP personality type -- very common among programmers I'd say. He wasn't good at micro managing himself until he found the tools to prevent bad habits (casually browsing the web) and track his progress to gather intelligence about how he works. He found [5 tools and 5 habits to do the trick](http://labs.oziti.com/increase-productivity) (among them [my Word Counter](http://wordcounterapp.com/)).

If you suffer from unwillingly checking your Twitter feed, have a look at his tips. There may be something for you, too. My flat mate un-learned wasting time on YouTube and Facebook with a tool last year. I recommend you give it a try and see for yourself if that sounds like you.
