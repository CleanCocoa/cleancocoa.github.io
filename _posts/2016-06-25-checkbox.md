Check boxes in AppKit are realized with buttons. The API reads kind of weird, so here's a simple subclass:

    #!swift
    class CheckBox: NSButton {    
        var checked: Bool {
            get { return state == NSOnState }
            set { state = newValue ? NSOnState : NSOffState }
        }
    }

Now it's easy to use `checkbox.checked = true`. I'd even consider `check()` and `uncheck()` methods if I used this in many places to reduce the noise and clarify what's going on.
