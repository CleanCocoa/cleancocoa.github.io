It happens quite a lot that I want to create a small UML diagram. Mostly for this website, but often for books, too. All the Java-based Mac applications get on my nerves quickly, though.

That's when I found [draw.io](http://draw.io/) the other day.

It's simple, lightweight, and works from within your browser with various storage options.

I liked it a lot and can only recommend it. The output may not be the prettiest in the world, but it's way better than drawing diagrams yourself.

(Consider this a teaser for the upcoming book. Guess what it's about. You'll get a copy for free if you tell me until Sep. 11th.)
