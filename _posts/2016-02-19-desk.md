I [shared](http://masilotti.com/favorite-things) that picture the other day and though, well, why not share an updated picture of my workplace here, too?

[Since 2013](/posts/2013/05/my-workspace/), some things have changed. This is my equipment:

*   MacMini Late 2011 (256&nbsp;GB SSD, 8&nbsp;GB RAM),
*   the same HP LP2275W 22-inch screen with a very decent viewing angle,
*   a Kinesis Freestyle 2 split keyboard (English keyboard layout) spread to support external rotation of the shoulders,[^neo]
*   a Magic Trackpad,
*   a Faber-Castell 0.5mm mechanical pencil,
*   a 1.5 liter water carafe + clay cup,
*   a bespoke lamp built with LEGO bricks,
*   lots of plants, most of which are not on the picture.
