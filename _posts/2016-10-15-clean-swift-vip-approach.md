The folks at Swifting.io wrote [a blog post](https://swifting.io/blog/2016/09/07/architecture-wars-a-new-hope/) about iOS software architectures. The comparison of [VIPER](https://swifting.io/blog/2016/09/07/architecture-wars-a-new-hope/#viper) and [Clean Swift/VIP](https://swifting.io/blog/2016/09/07/architecture-wars-a-new-hope/#vipcleanswift) is very interesting: the VIP approach favors [uni-directional flow](/posts/tags/1df/), which I like very much. The article is worth a read for that alone!

They [falsely](/posts/2016/10/mvvms-place/) consider MVC and MVVM to be software architecture approaches, though, and too point out that MVVM and MVC [suffer from similar drawbacks.](/posts/2016/08/mvvm-is-okay-for-what-it-does/)
