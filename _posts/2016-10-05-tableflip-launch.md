I pushed the button. Now **[TableFlip is here!](http://tableflipapp.com/)**

TableFlip is a text-based visual table editor. It will become your go-to application to edit tabular data because it's blazingly fast, lightweight, and fun to use. 

You can use it to quickly create tables from scratch and copy the result anywhere -- or you can use it to edit tables in existing documents. That's what "flipping" stands for:

{% include figure.md src="/assets/blog/2016/flipping.png" alt="screenshot of TableFlip" url="http://tableflipapp.com/" caption="Open your document in TableFlip and you can it in your editor AND in TableFlip simultaneously!" %}

TableFlip is designed to remedy a pain in your Markdown workflow: handling table markup. Typing Markdown tables sucks. TableFlip lets you edit data in a slick visual interface. And then it saves the result as clean Markdown -- right into your existing documents where you want it.

**[Get TableFlip at 20% off](http://tableflipapp.com/)** until Oct. 15th, only!
