Just a few days ago, Fletcher [released the first Beta of his new and improved MultiMarkdown][mmd3] tool.  Markup-wise, not much has changed, at least not for me.  I'm going to include this newer and faster iteration of his MMD-converter in my next Notational Velocity "maintenance" release (in which I incorporate changes of the little tools I rely on---a lot has happened the past two months!).
