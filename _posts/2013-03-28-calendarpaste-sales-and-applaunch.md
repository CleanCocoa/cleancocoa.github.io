I kept this one in the queue for some time for various reasons.  One, I procrastinated making the sales stats public because I wanted to see whether and how I could affect them to look nicer than they turned out to look.  Second, I don't really feel comfortable giving others, namely AppLaunch, bad press.

## Sales stats

After a lot of blog attention in December and January, sales of [Calendar Paste](http://calendarpasteapp.com) declined quickly.  I think Hilton is right, [it's just to be expected your sales drop][1]---well, unless you've got a blockbuster like Angry Birds.

Of course I may be prone to a cognitive fallacy here:  I could wish Hilton is right so I got an excuse for bad sales which takes me and my efforts out of the equation.

Anyway, here's the graph:

{% include figure.md src="/assets/blog/2013/201303281407_stats.png" alt="March 2013 sales stats" %}

In both February and March I scored about **0.5 app sales per day**.  Here's the detailled breakdown:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>2012</th><th colspan="3">2013</th><th>&nbsp;</th></tr>
        <tr><th>Dec</th><th>Jan</th><th>Feb</th><th>Mar</th><th class="total">total</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr class="numerical">
        <td>195</td>
        <td>347</td>
        <td>18</td>
        <td>17</td>
        <td class="total">=577</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Equals about US&nbsp;$400 (315&nbsp;EUR).  Divided by [115 hours][5] raises my hourly wage to roughly US&nbsp;$3.50 (2,75 EUR).  I should still go to jail for exploiting my own labor.  But hey, the wages have almost _tripled_!

## Explicitely not recommending AppLaunch

Now to the hard part.

{% include figure.md src="/assets/blog/2013/201303281334_applaunch.us.png" alt="AppLaunch pricing" %}

I tried [AppLaunch][2][^fn] in February, re-investing my first month of sales in the largest discounted offering at a price of US&nbsp;$125.  The form looked slick and all, but after they started to "create my campaign" things were taken from my hands.  I couldn't edit anything anymore for days, then all of a sudden [a press release for Calendar Paste][3] was live and e-mail notifications informed me of Press Kit downloads.

Thing was, the Press Kit was faulty and still is, even after various e-mails I exchanged with the people at AppLaunch:  instead of three screenshots of the app, one shot was repeated three times:

{% include figure.md src="/assets/blog/2013/201303281344_calendar_paste_press_release.png" alt="Calendar Paste press release at AppLaunch" %}


I guess this happened because my screenshots had the same filename: `4inch_retina.png`.  During the upload this might have caused trouble for the script which processed the form.  Whatever the reason, images were never replaced, not in time and not two months after.  I guess it's way too late now to matter anymore.

Still, the experience sucked after shelling out US $125.

* **Missing Feedback:**  After preparing the press release, the developer should be informed to double-check if everything went alright.  Everyone writes a shitty file upload script sometimes.  Maybe I remember poorly and indeed did upload the same file three times (which is unlikely, still)---nevertheless, this issue could have been resolved in five minutes of manual approval.
* **Poor Service:**  I exchanged e-mails with the AppLaunch folks and got a first response to online contact form submissions, but they never replied to questions in following e-mails.  Never.  Sucks to be treated like that.

I wasn't too certain whether I was going to be a victim of scammers.  There was at least some evidence on Twitter that AppLaunch is no fraud, but it was poor nevertheless.  Still I cannot confirm they're scam.  I'm really disappointed, of course, but there's no reason to believe the worst.

As a matter of fact, I will and do not recommend AppLaunch to anyone.

Just ask your fellow blogger friends and take a look at the [Ultimate Cheat Sheet For Getting Reviews On Top Blogs][4] if you're not yet feeling comfortable writing e-mails.
