This week, I've released another app to the App Store:  [Tapping Test][it].

It's guiding you through the [finger tap test][ftt] to give hints on cognitive load. You measure your tapping speed and compare it to the last test. If you don't even come near your past baseline, this can be a sign of overall fatigue. 

This is no medical advice, mind you.

I wanted to do this app for so long because I wanted to find out when I have to enter a [deloading][deload] phase in my exercise plan.  To find out when I overdid it, I can use the finger tap test to gather some data.

I have to admit, though, my plan doesn't look all that exciting when viewed from a birds-eye view, with all exercise details stripped away:

* Monday: Strength training at 12 o'clock, circuit training (cardio) at noon
* Tuesday: Strength training at 12 o'clock, circuit training (cardio) at noon
* Wednesday: Sprinting and other peak-speed exercises
* Thursday: Strength training at 12 o'clock, circuit training (cardio) at noon
* Friday: Strength training at 12 o'clock, circuit training (cardio) at noon
* Saturday: Sprinting and other peak-speed exercises

Anyway, I usually have a load/deload cycle of four weeks total, with one week of deload. This gives me time to recover, but in the long term, I still have to take another step back and take it easy. The finger tap test is [said to help you find out when it's time.][elitefts]

So I now added the Tapping Test app to my arsenal of workout auto-regulation tools. Also, it's the first of a series of tools for [ImprovedEating.com][it].  ImprovedEating is a popular German blog about health and nutrition. There are  various tools in the making to help developing healthy habits. More on that soon.

**[Get the Tapping Test app for $.99 on the App Store!][it]**[^fn]

[^fn]: The iTunes App Store links are affiliate links so I get a small bonus when you buy apps from my link.

It syncs across devices via iCloud. I'm working on adding charts and automated test assessments. All coming in the following weeks.

I still need a few more people to help me with usability testing so I can work out interface quirks. If you're interested, [drop me a mail](/about): `christian.tietze` at `gmail.com`.  I'll send a promo code to the first ten people or so.

So that's _one_ part of what I've been busy with in the past weeks. I didn't find a lot of time to write, but I'm glad this app is finally shipping. I'll uncover what other project I'm working on early next week.
