The [Word Counter](http://wordcounterapp.com/) received a **huge** update this week. It now allows you to monitor files. That means you can create a record of your project progress. The usual words-per-hour meter will tell you how well you perform, while the file monitor can tell you how far you've come.

I'm excited to finally release this update. I think it'll help motivate a lot of people to make progress and marvel at their current achievements.

Up next is a graphical representation of all this, because visualizing helps to _see_ progress, obviously.

**If you have trouble downloading the update, please get a fresh download [from the website](http://wordcounterapp.com).** This will probably affect a lot of people. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience!
