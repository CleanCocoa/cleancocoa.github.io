I've just finished updating the book "Exploring Mac App Development Strategies" for Swift 3.

Looking at my Word Counter, this **4th edition** sports about 15000 new words in the book and code combined: I re-wrote a lot of chapters and source files. I also expanded a few sections to add more context and incorporate things I learned in the past 2 years.

There's another book in the making about universal software architecture and ReSwift, with a macOS and iOS sample app. If you want to beta test the book and get early access, drop me a line: <a href="mailto:&#x68;&#x69;&#x40;&#x63;&#x68;&#x72;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x74;&#x69;&#x65;&#x74;&#x7A;&#x65;&#x2E;&#x64;&#x65;">&#x68;&#x69;&#x40;&#x63;&#x68;&#x72;&#x69;&#x73;&#x74;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6E;&#x74;&#x69;&#x65;&#x74;&#x7A;&#x65;&#x2E;&#x64;&#x65;</a>
