I'm knees-deep in code and wait for new provisioning profiles from Apple to release an app for Mac next week. Fingers crossed!

Meanwhile, I wanted to care for my recently updated [Calendar Paste 2](http://calendarpasteapp.com) more and reach out to bloggers and the press to increase coverage.

Since this is a problem all indies have to deal with, I thought: why not share my e-mail template?

## My Calendar Paste pitch template

> Subject: **With Calendar Paste, you never need to write the same event details twice**
>
> Hi [first name], 
> 
> Calendar Paste 2 helps save time entering tasks which look the same but can't be put on a recurring schedule. With it, you **create calendar event templates to prepare events once only.**
> 
> _It closes the gap of missing copy & paste on the iPhone calendar._
> 
> Here's the gist of the app:
> 
> - Save time scheduling shift work, on-call duties, and irregularly recurring events.
> - Productivity folks like [Eddie Smith][2] of Practical Efficiency and [Brett Terpstra][1] use it a lot.
> - Create event templates to store all the details for later, then paste it into your calendar at a specific time.

My most recent changes:

* I began to try this subject line just this week. Lately, I used the lame "App review request: Calendar Paste - event templates for iPhone" or something similar. 
* I also sticked to plain text mails in the past, which could've been a mistake. We'll see!
* I've tweaked the intro paragraph according to [recent tips at appmasters.co](http://www.appmasters.co/fitmencook-pr-email-pitch/).

I'll share details once I know more about the effects.

What worked for you in the past?
