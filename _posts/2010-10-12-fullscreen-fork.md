Notational Velocity forks are popping out everywhere:  this one is especially interesting since it adds options to switch to **fullscreen editing mode**, or quickly **hide the notes list** to enlarge the text editor.  A **menu bar** icon is included as well, so Notational Velocity can be omnipresent without staying in the Dock, which is quite nice if you rely on invoking "NV" with a keyboard shortcut.

[Check David's fork out](http://elasticthreads.tumblr.com/nv) and help him with your feedback!

I'd love to merge the new implementation code with my underwhelming preview-enabling version of Notational Velocity, but sadly there's no code repository set up, yet.
