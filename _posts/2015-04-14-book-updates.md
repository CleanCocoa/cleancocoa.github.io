I have just updates the book _Exploring Mac App Development Strategies_ to Swift 1.2. A few sections were expanded, a few paragraphs rewritten -- but the big update is still underway. It's due this summer, and then I'll consider the book feature-complete.

Until then, check out the current deal for [_Creating Multi-Process Mac Applications_](https://leanpub.com/create-multi-process-mac-apps), which is available at a discount right now since it's an early release version.
