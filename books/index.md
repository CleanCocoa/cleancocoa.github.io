# Theory and Practice of Independent Software Development

Part of my life's work is dedicated to publishing a unified approach to becoming a good independent software developer. It'll probably take until 2020 until I have the basics. Then some more years to flesh out the details.

My approach is holistic: to be successful, it's not enough to know how to code. You need to be able to survive periods of despair and get by with little money. You need to figure out how to do marketing properly -- that is, how to reach people, and how to maintain personal integrity while you do so. That's why I'll write about the _life_ of being an independent software developer, not just the _work._

Here are the few books I already finished.
