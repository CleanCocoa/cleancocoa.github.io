title: Design Pattern
---

Design Patterns are applied code heuristics. The insight of a particular solution to a problem _in code_ is formalized for re-use.

In the 1990s, the famous ["Gang of Four" _Design Patterns_ book][gof] was released with a ton of patterns that help make object-oriented programming less painful. 

The Gang of Four-book aims to form a pattern language, a term introduced by the architect Christopher Alexander, who pioneered pattern language development with his book ["A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction"][alexander]. Alexander's book is a real treasure if you want to understand how to systematize and integrate knowledge: his patterns range from a level like "the rural landscape" down to stuff like "caf√©s" and "dressing rooms" or "compost". It's like a wiki for architects, each pattern presented in a formalized way to improve readability, containing abstracts, examples, and recommendations.
